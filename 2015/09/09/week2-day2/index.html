				<h3 class="section-heading">Minimum Viable Product</h3>

<p>After trying and failing in one approach to this project <a href="http://chweeks.github.io/2015/09/08/week2-day1/">yesterday</a> I was determined to try and make things as simple as possible for myself.</p>

<p>Today I was working with Alex, we worked extremely well together and had the same views as to how we should build the game. Unlike yesterday we started by building a very basic system where you can create a boat that holds co-ordinates. You then have a player that can fire at a set of chosen co-ordinates . These co-ordinates are then compared to all the co-ordinates held by the ships and if there's a match they are deleted and the boat is destroyed. This was all built with ships of size 1 and a 4X4 grid. After this was built it was just a case of slowly scaling up from this working start point. We slowly added things such as making sure you couldn't place a ship outside the grid, or on top of one another and also compiling arrays of each players hits and misses, so they can check their shot history..</p>

<p>Ideally we would like to automate the game as much as we can to minimise the user interaction with the code. We want to get it to a point where the user can just boot up the game and then not have to input anything but co-ordinates, when placing a ship and when firing. We were extremely close to finishing this so hopefully we'll be able to get together at some point later in the week and finish it off.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Lexoo Lunch Talk</h3>

<p><img src="/img/lexoo.jpg" alt="lexoo" /></p>

<p>Today we had a talk by Chris Oâ€™Sullivan the CTO and co-founder of &lt;ahref="https://www.lexoo.co.uk"&gt;Lexoo, a place to get quick quotes from various lawyers online. He spoke about the best ways to ensure you save time and money when trying to create a business code wise. His key points were to write as little code as possible, get someone else to code instead and popping the 'Why?' stack. Writing as little code as possible means saving your time and hence money and also means it is easier to maintain. Getting someone else to write the code is again based on saving your time and therefore money. Why spend time trying to recreate a service that someone else has already made when you can be focussing on your product. Finally popping the 'Why?' stack, when implementing a new feature of your product you should ask yourself/team why you are doing it. If you keep recursively asking why, it should come down to these three reasons:
<ul><li>Protect revenue</li>
<li>Increase revenue</li>
<li>Manage cost</li>
</ul>
 If it doesn't do one of these things then it is most likely a non-essential feature and your time and money is best spent elsewhere.
