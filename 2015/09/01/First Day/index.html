				<h3 class="section-heading">The Name Game</h3>

<p>The first day at Maker's was absolutely not what I expected and at the same time was the perfect start. First thing to mention is that absolutely no code was written on the first day. The day was all about getting to know the others in your cohort and an explanation of the structure of each day/week.</p>

<p>There was no time for being shy as we were instantly told to pair up with someone. In 5 minutes we would then, as a pair, introduce each other to the rest of the group. I paired up with Yana, who used to be a tax Lawyer back in Russia but has come here so she can do something she actually enjoys instead. We then played the name game where, standing in a circle, we have to name everyone in the circle and where they're from. This surprisingly worked and I can now name all the 30 odd people in my cohort.</p>

<p>We were then split into small groups and were given 15 minutes to build a spaghetti tower. The aim was to build the tower as high as we could with the materials we were given and place a marshmallow at the top of the tower. It's safe to say my group did not win this challenge despite having an engineer in the group. I'm glad I didn't take a picture of it as it was possibly the ugliest thing ever constructed. Nonetheless it was fun building this monstrosity and we all had a good laugh.</p>

<p>We were then given a small talk on the significance of this challenge and which teams do better and why. Rather than try explain it myself, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0_yKBitO8M">here is a TED talk </a> that does it a lot better.</p>

<p>A lot more stuff was said and done but their was so much of it that the only other thing I remember after this was the pub. I only stayed for a drink or two (on Makers) but still only managed to get home at 10pm. The northern line was down and so ended up walking and getting two buses home. Yay public transport. </p>
