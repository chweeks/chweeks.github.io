				<h3 class="section-heading">Do Over</h3>

<p>This morning we had our standup run, with boundless energy as always, by our coach Tansaku. We discussed what we had struggled with the day before and a large topic of discussion was the containment of error methods within blocks rather than normal parenthesis. We were also given the task of writing a blog post on Red-Green-Refactor and how its linked to Test Driven Development which I've already mentioned <a href="http://chweeks.github.io/2015/09/02/day2/">here.</a></p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Boris Bikes part-2</h3>

<p>After the standup we split into our new pairing partners for the day. I was paired with David who was a great guy to work with. It was here that I realised how much Philip and I had done the day before, which I was glad to know as we were working till around 8 last night. On the other hand, the way the pair programming works here means that you always jump down to the code of the person who has done less. This means no one is rushed and has an equal opportunity to work through the projects in their own time. It also gives the chance to the person jumping down to reinforce what they've learnt by guiding their pair through the challenges. Although you know in the long run this way of things will help rather than hinder you, it is tough to not get frustrated when you think of how far you could get if you were working on your own.</p>

<p>By the afternoon we had caught up to my work from the day before and then started to make great strides into the rest of the project. We worked really well together and there were a lot of good 'debates' through the day on which way to do things. This made sure we understood and knew why we thought our way was best, which ensured we learnt the most we could from each other.</p>

<p>After yesterday I really didn't fancy staying too late and so left pretty early as we made some good progress in the afternoon and very close to finishing the project.</p>
