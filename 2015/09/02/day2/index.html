				<h3 class="section-heading">Standup</h3>

<p>The second day started with the cohort separating into bytes (small groups) in order to have their standups. This ideally is a short meeting in the morning to discuss what you had done the day before and what you plan to do today. We would also share what we had struggled with in order to get our coaches input. Obviously we hadn't written any code yet and so it was simply to get used to the idea of a standup and for our coach (Sam A.K.A Tansaku) to tell us our projects for the week.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Boris Bikes</h3>

<p>The project for our first week is to create a system that'll simulate the use of Boris Bikes. The basics of what we achieved today was creating a DockingStation class that has a capacity, could have a bike docked into it and also release a bike to a customer. We also created Bike class which creates a bike that can be working or not. We also implemented various other features but nothing too taxing. The code itself was the easiest part of the first day it's the test driven development that drove me a bit crazy.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Test Driven Development</h3>

<p>TDD is a software development process which repeats a small cycle of development.
<ol>
<li>Write an initially failing test for a new feature or function you wish to implement</li>
<li>Write the bare minimum amount of code that will pass the test</li>
<li>Refactor the code to a decent standard</li>
<li>Repeat the process</li>
</ol>

This is also known as the Red-Green-Refactor cycle, red referring to the failed test, green the passed test and refactor.</p>

<p><img src="/img/rgrefactor.jpg" alt="rgrefactor" /></p>

<p>This allows you to change little bits at a time and so always have a working code base that you can jump back to or go live if needed. This style also makes it a lot easier for the next developer working on the code to understand what it does and how it works.</p>

<p>Writing the tests first was a difficult concept to come to terms with as all you wanted to do was just get your head down and start creating features. It was also made more difficult as the tests are written using Rspec which, although is pure Ruby, has a whole new set of syntax to learn. The pair programming aspect of it was also a bit strange to begin with but I had a great partner in Phil and by the end of the day I was pretty confident with the syntax and the TDD side of it was coming easier and making more sense.</p>
