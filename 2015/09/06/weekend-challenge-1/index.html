				<h3 class="section-heading">The Task</h3>

<p>Every week we have a weekend challenge meant to test and solidify what we have learnt throughout the week. We were told to ensure that by Monday morning at 9AM we had submitted a pull request with our challenge with even the smallest amount of code if necessary, just something. We were also told about not worrying about completely finishing the Boris-Bikes project before starting the challenge. So naturally I went about completing the Boris-Bikes challenge all Saturday and didn't even look at the challenge till Sunday.</p>
<p>Our challenge for the weekend was to create a basic simulation of an airport through a set of given user stories. The task had very similar elements to the Boris-Bikes projects. We had two Objects a plane and an airport. A plane needed to have a status, either flying or landed. The airport needed to be able to instruct the plane to land and to instruct it to take off. The planes couldn't land if the airport was full and couldn't land or take off when the weather was stormy.</p>
<p>The code itself was very simple but as usual it was the tests that made it tricky. Having a random method for the chance of stormy weather made the tests more difficult as we had to learn about stubbing. Essentially when testing to make sure the planes couldn't land or take off in stormy weather I had to 'stub' the random_weather method to ensure that the weather was always stormy for those tests. </p>
<p>Once submitted the code gets 'marked' and I use marked very loosely as when its submitted some automated tests are run on the code. The main test is that all your written tests pass and also that your tests cover everything within the system. I got a hundred percent coverage which I was really happy with but then there was hound. From what I understand this hound program goes through your code and tests its readability. It throws up errors for lines and methods that are too long or if indentation is wrong. I had one of these errors that I just couldn't seem to shake for the longest time but managed to succeed in the end.</p>

<p> My first week at Makers has been an amazing experience, I've had a lot of fun and have learnt more than I thought possible. Their have been some great moments where you seem to understand everything and feel like a god, but their have been even more moments where you come crashing face first back down to earth and realise you have but scratched the surface.</p>
