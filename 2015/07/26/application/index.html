				<h3 class="section-heading">Online Application</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://apply.makersacademy.com/">application process</a> for Makers is said to be rather selective, quoted on their site to be <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/about-us/">1 in 10</a>. This ensures they get the people they believe will make it through the course and can put forward to their hiring partners. This is extremely important for them as Makers gets a placement fee when one of their graduates is hired by a partner company and this is where they make a profit.</p>

<p>Having said that, the application itself is not very strenuous, it simply involves two questions to gauge your motivation:  </p>

<ul> <li>Why do you want to attend Makers Academy?</li>  
<li>How have you learnt to code so far?</li>  
</ul>

<p>I got a reply five days after submitting my application with instructions to book an interview. I booked it for two weeks after that and was given material to go over before the interview.  </p>

<ul><li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a> Ruby course</li>  
<li>First 8 chapters of Chris Pines '<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz17qR4zZedib0M5RnRwWFl3MUk/view">Learn To Program'</a></li></ul>

<p>Luckily I had already gone through these before I applied but still repeated it a couple of times to make sure I didn't look like an idiot. I was told the interview would be split into three parts:  </p>

<ol><li>Introduction to Makers</li>  
<li>A few logic games</li>  
<li>Short pair-programming session</li></ol>

<h3 class="section-heading">The Interview</h3>

<p>My interview experience was great, when I arrived (after getting a little lost) everyone was nice and welcoming and it was all really relaxed. I then met Nikesh who was interviewing me and he told me all about Makers, what they do, what they expect of a student and what the student can expect from them. Essentially if you work extremely hard, learn the content, complete all the challenges on time/to a good standard and you can work well with everyone, then they can confidently present you to their hiring partners. </p>

<p>I didn't really have a logic games section in my interview. After the introduction it was mainly answering questions like, why I wanted to join the course and what I had done prior to the course in terms of coding. </p>

<p>Next was on to the the pair programming, which involved going through a few exercises on <a href="http://www.codewars.com"> Codewars </a>. These exercises should be easy if you've done the preparation they suggested. It was more just showing that you can take advice on board and that you can break down a problem. This was where I was shown the important difference between good code and code that simply works.</p>

<p>The whole process was very relaxed and after the pair programming we just chatted for a while about the course and Nikesh answered any questions I had. I heard back about 5 days later that all went well and I could book my place on the course! </p>
