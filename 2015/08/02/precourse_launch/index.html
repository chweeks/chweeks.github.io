				<h3 class="section-heading">The Launch</h3>

<p><q>No stupid questions</q>-Nikesh Ashar</p>

<p>After my interview things started to move very quickly, I had managed to squeeze into the last few places left on the September course. This meant my pre-course would be starting soon, the following week in fact. This felt very quick because when I booked onto the September course I thought that was the pre-course start date, my bad. Essentially it meant I was starting a month sooner than I thought, which was exciting.</p>

<p><img src="/img/im-ready.jpg" alt="spongebob" /></p>

<p>After a series of confused (on my end) email exchanges with Nikesh, who runs the precourse, I'd sussed the aforementioned issue and was told we would be having a pre-course launch the day before the course at Makers studio. The launch was a chance to meet the team at Makers and the students all gave a quick introuction of themselves to the rest of the group. There was also a couple of people in a google hangout as they couldn't make it on the day. This was a bit problematic and ended in a half hour recording of one girls' face and a lot of broken talking and shouting at a lagging screen. Despite this hilarious hiccup it was a good night and the main emphasis was on how we would attack each weeks work. The gist of it was to try it alone and if you have a problem research it and try again, then ask your peers on the course and open up an issue on github. I'm guessing this is to ensure we try and fail (a lot!) in order to learn rather than spamming any of the seniors or Nikesh with any little problems we encounter.</p>

<p> Unfortunately I had to travel out of London again that night so I couldn't stay and get to know the people on my course a little bit better but everyone seemed really nice and I'm sure there'll be plenty of opportunity for that in the future. At the moment I'm just ready to get on with the work and learn as much as I can before I start full-time.</p>

<p>P.S He meant 'no such thing as stupid questions'</p>
