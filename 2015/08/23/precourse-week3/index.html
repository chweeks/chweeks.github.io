				<h3 class="section-heading">Pair Programming</h3>
<p>As part of our preparation for the course ahead, we were encouraged to organise a pair programming session with our mentors this week. As we were also invited to attend the senior class' graduation on Friday I planned to meet my mentor (Lewis) Friday afternoon. The pair programming session was great, Lewis was encouraging and we decided to try and refactor a Chris Pine exercise I had completed earlier. Working with a partner while coding is a rather strange feeling. Normally I would just think things through in my head, start typing and just chop and change the code as I went along. In a pair you have to work a bit differently, you have to try and verbalise your thought process in order for your partner to understand your thinking and what your doing.</p>

<p>Lewis also spoke to me about the concept of 'smelly' code, where the code may work but doesn't look quite right. This essentially comes down to making your code as readable as you can. This makes it easy for someone to jump in and understand what your program does and doesn't do and edit it if necessary. Once we'd worked through the code and made it use recursion rather than a while loop, we just chatted about the course and how things work for the first couple of weeks when you get there.</p>

<p>All in all it was some nice preparation for the daily pair programming I'll be doing on the course. Lewis told me I'll generally have a new partner to work with everyday and as a pair you'll revert to working on the code of the person who hasn't got as far. This makes sure everyone's on a level playing field and allows the person ahead to reinforce their learning through explaining how its done.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Senior Graduation</h3>
<p> The senior classes graduation was a fun event and it was great to see how much they'd achieved while on the course. The graduation started with a speech from Ruben (one of the founders of Makers), in which he spoke of the journey Makers Academy had gone through and how it had overcome the doubt people had in its ability to teach people to be developers in 12 weeks. This has now culminated (in his words) with various groups knocking on their doors and asking them to replicate their success overseas. He then spoke about a scholarship fund they had been working on in order to provide a student who had fallen out of main stream education, with next to no qualifications, with a place on their course. He was proud to announce that this person was here tonight and he was actually one of the graduates.</p>

<p> After Rubens speech, Sam was introduced, a man dressed in full Samurai/Centurion gear (code warrior). Either way Sam is the head of education and was their to introduce the graduating teams who were to give a presentation on their final projects. The final projects were very impressive and all very different. There was a memory training / tamagochi style mobile app,  a music streaming website, a kids mobile game to help make sight seeing fun and even an 'Airbnb but for camping' app. All the projects were really well presented and the teams enthusiasm was clear to see. After the presentations there were representatives of some of the hiring partners there to talk to the teams about their projects in some more depth and there was plenty of beer being passed around.</p>

<p>All of this has made me want to really get this course going and makes me excited for what I'll be able to build once the course is over. Congrats to the graduates and good luck.</p>
