				<h3 class="section-heading">Round Up</h3>

<p>After the pre-course launch on Monday all the learning material for the four weeks of the pre-course was made available.</p>
<ul>
<li>Week 1 : Command Line</li>
<li>Week 2 : Version Control using Git and Github</li>
<li>Weeks 3 &amp; 4 : Ruby</li>
</ul>

<p>Although all the study material is available, the challenges associated with each week are released on the Friday of that week and are due to be completed Monday morning of the following week. Luckily I managed to grab the first weeks challenge off of the Makers academy github page and so finished it quite early. I had done a fair bit of command line work before the course so I knew the general commands and took to it fairly quickly. The material shows and explains the main commands used and gets you to learn them through repetition and repetition until it just starts to flow naturally. The challenge itself is very simple as long as you have worked through the material and learnt the <a href="https://github.com/chweeks/command-line">Essential Commands</a>.</p>

<p>Since I had completed the first weeks work by Wednesday afternoon I moved on to week 2. This teaches you the fundamentals of version control using 'Git Commands' and how to push (upload) and pull (download) code to and from your local folders to a corresponding repository on github.</p>

<p>The essence of version control is a system that recorded changes to a file or a project over time. These changes can come from one source if its a private project or could be coming from a team of people working on a web app. It essentially allows you to revert back to older versions of your code if someone (probably you) cocks up. The idea is to add small changes/features, early and often, to a project and document them in order to create a timeline of differing working versions of the code.</p>

<p>This again was rather simple but extremely important and can be a bit frustrating when trying to execute commands that aren't working, then realising you're an idiot and were in the wrong directory. Maybe that's just me but either way, repetition is key and it'll come naturally in the end. Annoyingly week 2's challenge won't be out until next Friday and so I will be pushing on to weeks 3 &amp; 4 and try to get as much of a headstart with learning the Ruby language as I can.</p>

<p> All in all this first week has been fun and not too challenging, the worst thing by far is getting all the software set up on my PC. Yes I know Windows eurgh, but even on a MacBook it is still a bit of a nightmare getting all the different pieces you need and I don't even know what half of it does yet.</p>

<p>Don't even get me started on what a pain this blog was to setup...</p>
